## Listen First, Talk Second
Hey! Welcome to my first blog post. My name is Casey Stamper. I am a senior software engineer and author of this blog.

### Background
Four years ago, I started my professional career as a software engineer by joining the R&D team as an intern at Bandwidth. I learned how to produce and ship code, receive peer review feedback, and work on a professional software development team. Today, I'm responsible for leading the integrations team at Bandwidth. I ensure high-quality and timely delivery of software features from ideation to production. We work on batch-processing applications, IaC (infrastructure as code), customer facing REST-APIs, and everything in-between. In just four short year, I've nurtured my technical and interpersonal skills and advanced from intern to senior software engineer. I attribute my growth to being able to listen first, and talk second.

### Listen first, talk second
In today's digital age, where communication often takes place through instant messages, emails, and video calls, genuine listening has become a rare commodity. We're quick to offer our opinions, share our ideas, and assert our expertise without taking the time to truly understand the perspectives of others. However, in software engineering, where collaboration is key and diverse viewpoints drive innovation, this lack of listening can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and ultimately, suboptimal outcomes.

I believe in the principle of "listen first, talk second" because of how well it has served me in leading a team of successful developers, and because of how simple it is to apply in the real-world. Before I share my perspective when presented with a problem from the team, I often reverse the question back to them.

"That's an interesting problem. What would you suggest?"

Although I already had an answer in my back pocket (this is your responsibility as team lead and decision maker), lettings others on the team communicate their thoughts first garners confidence, collaboration, and growth. You'd be surprised how many times another engineer will mention the same solution you had in mind (win-win), or come up with a better one!

For a broader application of "listen first, talk second," I would practice these two habits:
1. Ask clarifying questions: Seek clarification when needed to ensure that you fully understand the speaker's perspective and intentions.
2. Be open-minded: Approach discussions with a willingness to learn from others and consider alternative viewpoints, even if they differ from your own.

### Conclusion
In the world of software engineering, where effective communication and collaboration are essential for success, the ability to listen first and talk second is a powerful asset. By embracing the art of listening, we can foster stronger relationships, drive innovation, and ultimately, build better software that meets the needs of users and stakeholders alike. So, the next time you find yourself in a conversation, remember to pause, listen attentively, and truly hear what others have to say before sharing your own thoughts.
